you're gonna put petrol in the policecar .

because you should really put the petrol in in about there .
you don't put it in there .
you put it about there .
okay ?
no .
you don't .
that's because you're just putting petrol all over the driver .
i don't think he likes that .

and you've got more than enough there .
come on .
ow .
my hand was there .

that's not putting them away .
that's throwing them .

you're not getting out the cars .
we have this argument every time .
you will not listen .
you're not having them dominic .
you put away toys before you get any more out .
you're not getting them out .
put these away then if you're not playing with them please .
you're not .
well .
you're not having your cars out as well .
because if you've got your cars out it means you're not playing with those .

you just wait .
if you don't do as you're told .
you think you can get away with things like being nasty .
this is why i said to you this morning you weren't gonna get a present because you weren't gonna behave .
i was right .
that's alright .
caroline can see your true colors now .
this is exactly why i said you weren't gonna get a toy this morning .
because you were being naughty .
you were being naughty yesterday .
and i knew you were gonna be the same today .
i all i said to you was if you're not gonna play with them put them away .
that's simple enough .
simple enough .
and you hadta be awkward .
it's alright .
i'm not bothered .
gonna be silly you can go back to bed and when i go to the shops you can stay here .
well .
it's up to you .
you have to behave then don't you ?
you're definitely not coming to the shops with me now .
while you're being like this .
because i'll end up putting you in the boot of the car .
you do anything to me nasty and i'm gonna smack you .
do you understand ?
it's up to you .
and i will tell daddy to take those toys to the orphans like he said if you were gonna be naughty .
right .
that does it .
just wait until your dad comes back .
no .
i'm sorry .
you can't learn to behave you're not gonna get what you want .
no .
you've got to learn to behave .
got to learn to behave dominic .
i'm not putting up with it .
you will not be going to the nursery party tomorrow if you carry on like this .
you can stay at home .
and miss out .
got to learn to do as you're told dominic .
hitting me is not gonna get you what you want dominic .
so i suggest you pack it in please .
you're gonna get a smack soon so i suggest you pack it in .
giving me dirty looks isn't gonna help your cause .
are you gonna start to behave ?
hm ?
are you gonna start to behave ?
it's up to you .
what ?
if you've hurt your eyes it's because you've been naughty .
thank you .
well .
are you gonna start to behave ?
you didn't need all the cars out .
you played with them earlier .
you i said to take a few out .
you've got a few .
you don't need any more .
that's alright .
that's fine .
you carry on dominic .
because i'm not .
i'm not taking you to the shop with me while you're being like this .
you can stay at home .
you carry on hitting me dominic .
i'm not bothered .
you're gonna learn the hard way that it doesn't pay to be nasty and cruel .
are you putting them away now ?
well .
it would help if you put them on right .
let's start with the purple one first .
that's not right .

that's alright .
that's alright .
that's one less present you're gonna get .
if you're gonna carry on like this .
you're gonna have a very boring christmas young man .
are you gonna put the other things away then ?
are you gonna start to play nicely now ?
or are you gonna be unreasonable again ?
well .
are you going to be nice ?
i'll take that to be a no then shall i ?
fridge .

the cow's not going to eat me .
or your sister .

let me tip her up .
is the cow trying to get into nina's cot ?
what's nina doing ?
what's nina doing ?

that's not very nice .
she wasn't doing any harm .
dominic .
you weren't even playing with it .
dominic .
you were playing with the animals .
why are you taking the basket off your sister ?
that wasn't very nice at all .
dominic .
let her play with them .
you weren't playing with it so does it matter ?
you're being awkward today aren't you ?
what was that nina ?
dominic .
that's enough now .
your sister's got enough to play with .
if you wanna play with something you play with them .
dominic .
i'm sorry but .
i'm sorry but you're gonna find that you're gonna have a very nasty day today .
and we're not going to the shops now because you can't behave .
i'll wait until your dad comes back .
before i go .
and i'll go on my own .
dominic .

what did you say ?
you that's what you said to daddy yesterday when you were being cheeky .
you said you didn't say anything when you did .
nina's not being naughty .

because you're deliberately not listening to anything anybody ever says to you .
it's alright dominic .
i'm counting up all the things you do .
and i'm gonna tell your dad .
and we're not going to the shops .
and you can stay in your bed room on your own .

bearing in mind you're the one why plays with them .

go and get the grey one then .
the train's in there .
the train's track .
it's a track isn't it ?
you wouldn't make space for it so i made you a little one .
so i put the rest in there .
alright ?
oh dear .
yes .
it has .
because you were a bit too fast for it .
you put your big foot on it then .
can i have a play ?
yeah .
this train set .
oh .
is it gonna go fast ?
do you want me to let it go fast ?
why not ?
the train's gonna come off the track because the track's broken look .
oh dominic .
oh dominic .

i wanna do i ?
how do you know i wanna ?
oh .
alright then .
but i haven't got a train .
so .

don't bother .
because i know where they are .

no .
don't .
alright then .
i'll play with this one seeing as you're going off .
well .
stay here and play with it then .
don't bother .
i don't want one now .
i'll play with your cars .
honestly .
thank you anyway .
oh dear .
beware .
oh dear .
you're being a bit rough .
that's why it keeps coming off .
there .
now .
you'd better slow down with it .
or they will be coming off the track .
you'll have to move your track on on a bit .
that's it .
there's feet on the line .
vroom .
no .
you went too fast .
look .
there's a passenger waiting for the .
was waiting for the train .
you're sposta give him a lift .
not kick him off .
you're sposta stop and put him on the train .
well well .
we know what you think of pooh bear don't we ?
now .
let pooh bear ride on the back .
you have to go slowly .
well .
there you go .
that wasn't very nice was it ?
oh .
i think you're gonna have to slow down a bit .
oh .
right .
pooh bear's gonna stand here and insist that he gets a lift .
now .
can i have a lift .
please can i have a lift ?
no ?
why not ?
i'll give you a penny .
two pennys .
three pennys .
four pennys .
goodness .
we are noisy aren't we ?
keep you prisoner now .
excuse me .
this is the same child that shuts every door .
in such such as way that i think he's gonna trap his fingers .
so i don't think that's very fair .
telling me not to shut door .
why ?
well .
winnie the pooh's there .
are you gonna pick him up then ?
no .
you have to go very slow .
and keep the train on the track .
no no no .
is it alright if your sister has one of your vans ?
no .
that's pooh bear .
don't you want him now ?
wanna what ?
winnie pooh hasn't got a van .
no .
he hasn't .
where's his van then ?
oh no .
the track's broken .
can you fix it ?
you're sposta say i can't but i know a man who can .
well .
daddy can fix it can he ?
the train fell off the track did it ?
did you play with the other train set ?
you have got another one .
daddy brought it for you last week .
you remember that little one ?
the little wind up thomas with the key ?
did you play with that last night ?
you'll get it soon .
not yet .
no .
i know .
it will do .
and i'll fix it up later .
but only if you tidy up this mess .
because i'm not gonna put it out if you've got all these things out .
because we need some space for it .
not enough space .
it needs at least this much space .
and you've got to leave it alone .
you have to let it run round the track .
and not keep picking it up like you do .
oh boy .
who's not putting their hand over their mouth ?
who's not putting their hand over their mouth ?
go away ?
you can't tell the train and the truck to go away .
that's not very fair .
why can't he go on the back ?
why not ?
what's moved ?
it goes back together .
who's not putting their hand over their mouth ?
who's gonna get tickled until he do .
there .
what're you gonna do with that ?
on back .
will it stay ?
it will not stay like that .
i think you have to put it that way .
like that .
if you go too fast it'll fall off .
i wonder if you'll love trains if you're older .
or if you'll have grown out of it by then .
i know .
because you're going too fast for it .
can i take it ?
why not ?
a ?
i've got to get the letter a .
you find me the letter a then .
what letter's this one then ?
what letter's that one ?
no .
what letter is it ?
okay .
you find me the letter a .
if you can .
well done .
can you find me the letter e .
e .
where's the e ?
where is it ?
well .
can you fetch it for me please ?
yes .
that's right .
well .
it's not really sposta be on the track darling .
in real life if you found a car on the track the train would knock it off .
there'd be a crash .
oh .
vroom .
oh sorry .
sorry .
oh .
is the train helping the car ?
well .
what's the car doing on the track ?
because cars don't go on tracks like that dominic .
cars don't go on tracks like that you know .
no .
they don't .
no .
they don't .
funny enough .
there .
oh .
grrr .
why did you do that ?
dominic .
be careful .
don't you ?
sorry .
why not ?
is do you think it's gonna squash your car ?
well .
you sit on your cars all the time .
oh .
dominic .
mind your foot .
oh .
that's it .
oh .
i'm sorry dominic .
i thought you wanted me to help you .
mhm .
oh !
there .
so .
you've got one two three things on the track that shouldn't really be on there .
hey !
are you not talking to me now ?
who's that ?
i know it can't go .
well .
actually .
they're sposta stay on there dominic .
trains don't crash as often as that you know .
despite everything .
does that join with that one ?
doesn't it ?
it does .
there you go .
oh dominic .
let her have something .
that's very generous of you .
is it alright if she has postman pat's van ?
okay .
well .
she it's because she's grabbing things .
i will not let her eat it .
you useta do things like that .
wait until you she's a bit bigger and she clouts you over the head with one of them .
dominic .
don't get upset .
she's only moving them .
she's not doing any harm .
she's only moving them .
she's not doing any harm .
don't worry about it .
alright ?
oh .
leave it there .
right .
i'll move it back over here if you don't want it .
you are a little .
you are a little horror .
now .
it's gone from being just a train track to being everything else .
you're not not sure what you wanna play with are you ?
well .
what do you wanna play with ?
oh .
train and cars .
dominic .
trains don't always crash .
that's what i keep saying to you .
i know on your thomas video they crash but they don't always you know .
honestly .
gordon fell in a ditch because he was being naughty .
gordon didn't fall in the hole .
thomas fell in the hole .
no .
he didn't fall in a hole .
gordon pulled thomas out .
you don't remember your videos and you watch them more than we do .
you really don't watch them properly else you'd know .
that's because you've got a fidgety bum and start wandering around when they're on .
well .
that's not how you're sposta play with it is it ?
i said it's one of my favorite cars .
how do you know it's not my favorite car .
i don't want one .
i was just saying .
when you've got lots of money dominic you can buy me one .
oh .
no no .
it's the same .
it's a porsche .
but it's not the one that i like .
that's the one i like .
no .
it's that one .
i i didn't say it wasn't yours .
i said that's the one that i like .
that's alright .
i've got the other porsche .
and i'm not bothered .
this is the one that if i had money i'd buy dominic .
this one .
i know it's yours .
oh .
oh .
put this here ?
there .
so .
what did you say you wanted for your birthday then ?
